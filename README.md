## Current active projects

### [CWF](https://github.com/noobcollective/cwf) / copy with friends
CWF is a collaborative clipboard for friends or teams. \
It consists of small server where all the files are saved and the client CLI to send and fetch informations from/to the server. \

Our main goal with CWF is to build a nice collaborative tool for us \
and also to learn [Go](https://go.dev/).

## OS
I used to use Arch Linux + Hyprland ‚ù§Ô∏è as my main OS. I learned a lot while ricing and tuning \
the whole system to match my workflow.

In March 2024 I switched to MacOS because I wanted to try out something new and also because I wanted to \
compile a Flutter app to iOS (and you need MacOs for that...). I couldn't get used to the default behavior - so I \
customized MacOs as far as possible.

### Current setup
- Operating System: MacOs 15 Sequioa
- Window Manager: [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)
