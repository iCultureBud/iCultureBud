### [CWF](https://github.com/noobcollective/cwf) / copy with friends
CWF is a collaborative clipboard for friends or teams. \
It consists of small server where all the files are saved and the client CLI to send and fetch information from/to the server. \

Our main goal with CWF is to build a nice collaborative tool for us \
and also to learn [Go](https://go.dev/).
